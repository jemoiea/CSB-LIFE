“I have been reduced to silence and I have no right to hold up to them the ideal of reflection and to speak to them about poverty if I myself am not a poor man”


	For me, this quote is really a catchy one and it can reflect lots of people because when you see the word “poverty” is like, that is the situation of today for the majority. I chose this quote because it is great one because I really hate a judgmental person that’s why a chose this quote among the quotes I saw. It really gives me a big reflection. It simply states that when you don’t know anything about something better keep your mouth shut and don’t tend to speak. See how will yourself look if you speak of something that you really don’t know? See how will yourself look if you speak something about some status of life if it is not your status? How rude right? If I do that, speak of something I really don’t know, then I may get wrong and lead me to judging where in I really hate judging. So if your single since birth and you tend to speak about in a relationship status, is like your fooling yourself, you don’t have any experience about having a relationship and you tend to speak about it, yes you may have an idea about a relationship thing but still you’re lack of idea about it. Like this quotation, you know you are not a poor man, so you just keep your mouth shut about poverty, what you know about them? No money, little food to eat, almost none, really insulting right? For me sometimes, the best thing to do is we just keep quiet about the things we don’t know, we just don’t judge those things and we also give them respect.
