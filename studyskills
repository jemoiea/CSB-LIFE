Have you ever failed an exam?
Yes I do, because sometimes I'm too complacent with  my answers and
I'm too lazy to check it again if there's a wrong answer.

How was your first CSB Midterm experience? Knowing what you know now, 
what would you have done differently? How do you plan to prepare for the Finals?
My first CSB Midterm experience was great, there's a bit difference of how the exams 
were taken compare to my past school (high school). First is that when we have an exam 
almost 3-4 subjects were taken and there's no breaks. The time alloted for our midterm
here in CSB is much longer than my past. About the sitmates during midterm my sitmates
were my classmates but going back to my past school my sitmate wasn't my classmates 
or batch mates it's from other year level (e.g First Year, Fourth Year,First Year, Fourth year)
like that. What I've done differently is that I study more today than my previous days of
exams. My plan is that, I'll study harder, avoid temptations in life like going out with friends
just for nothing when finals is near.
