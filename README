What are the changes of my life because of college?

New role, new routines, new relationships and new assumptions...

        As a college student of today, I found out some new roles in my life. I know during my high school days I have practiced already being independent one, mostly when it comes to project making but then I know this is not enough so I found out that I became more independent. Next, I found out that I can be a great leader whenever there is a group activity because during my high school days I never get a chance to be elected as a leader because they never let others to be given a chance to be a leader and show what they can do. I became more responsible too when it comes to studies.

        We know that college life is merely different to high school life and it's impossible if you will not have some new routines. Now I wake up 5:30 in the morning not like when I'm in high school I almost wake up 6:30am-7:00am. Now I'm travelling that far because my school during high school is just walking distance from our house that's why I can wake up late, from 5mins. going to my school(high school) it became 45 minutes or more because I live in Muntinlupa City near Alabang.

        Well when it comes to relationships to friends, teachers etc.
